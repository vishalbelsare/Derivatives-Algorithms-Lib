## Introduction

This is a project inspired by following books:

* [*Derivatives Algorithms:  Volume 1: Bones* by Tom Hyer](https://github.com/TomHyer/DA_Bones_Mirror)
  
* [*Modern Computational Finance: AAD and Parallel Simulations* by Antoine Savine](https://github.com/asavine/CompFinance)

* [*Modern Computational Finance: Scripting for Derivatives and xVA* by Antoine Savine](https://github.com/asavine/Scripting)

At current stage, this codes repository is simply for prototyping and practice. Don't use them in serious situation.

> Some codes are directly copied from Tom and Antoine's books.
